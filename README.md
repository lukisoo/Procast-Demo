# Procast
The ultimate productivity tool that encourages you to keep that work-life balance. So basically, you can keep your calendar, tasks, projects, and notes all in one place, and whiel you work on those, you'll be sent friendly reminders that encourage you to take a break from your work for a 'good purpose'.

This project was created over 31st July - 1 August for the 2021 WDCC x SESA Hackathon, which was themed 'pro-procrastination'.

# Motivation
We know how difficult it is to keep that work-life balance nad get all your work donem yet still have time for yourself, your friends, and your family. So, we created 'Procast', your ultimate productivity tool that ensures you're able to do both!

Our app allows you to keep all yoru tasks, plans, projects, and notes all in one place, and also ensures you still have a life outside of your work. And by that we mean, as you set a timer and begin to work, we'll pop up friendly reminders and tips to take these breaks very often, such as nice threatening facts about the risks if you overwork yourself, very 'educational' YouTube videos, remidners for fun events happening near you so you can go outside and get some exercise, and reminders to play your favourite games with your friends to connect with them!
